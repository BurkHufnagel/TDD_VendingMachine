Vending Machine Emulator - Facilitator notes:
Removed the coin verifier as it seemed to be a distraction and stumbling block for those new to TDD.
The Smoke Tests should all pass, but one of the VendingMachineSpecification methods will fail because it's referencing a method that does not exist.

Walk through building a CoinDispenser - remember to refactor... and use setup() method for common code.

Under Want-To-Have, the requirement to light buttons based on the current amount of money available clashes with the Must-Have requirement to light the buttons if the associated rack is not empty. Learners should ask the business rep for clarification on what to do, not decide for themselves.

Questions:
  What happens if the user presses two buttons at the same time, or at least close enough that the brain hasn't had time to adjust the current amount of money available?
  In the part describing a successful purchase, there is no requirement to reduce the amount of money available by the purchase price of the item just bought, so how much change should be returned?
